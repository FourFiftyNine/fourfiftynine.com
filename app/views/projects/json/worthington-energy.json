  "overview": [
    "Worthington Energy needed a brand new look.  We looked outside the company to <a href='http://evankosowski.com/'>Evan Kosowski</a>, one of the many designers we have built a relationship with over the years.  His talent and vision helped us execute a new brand identity.  We took an outdated publicly traded company and gave them a fresh, modern feel, and a super slick new logo."
